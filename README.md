Smart-Telehealth Application

The purpose of this project is to decrease the evident disparity in access to health care by providing telehealth services through an application. The Smart-Telehealth system is designed to collect the correct information from patients that would allow health professionals to assess their patients, make the appropriate decisions without having the patient come in for an in-person visit. Implementing this application will help health professionals reduce the number of unnecessary interactions and focus their efforts towards patients in desperate need of healthcare. Further, it would provide people with minimal access to health care to receive consultations and other series while preserving money, time, and various resources.
